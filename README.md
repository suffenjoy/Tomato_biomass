# Tomato_biomass
Collaboration with Meerae Park. 
The field is an experiment field for tomatoes under different biostimulant treatments. 
The data come from multispectral and thermal UAV images, and a variety of ground measurements of above ground biomass and plant physiology. 
The first part of this work is to generate block average NDVI and canopy temperature.
